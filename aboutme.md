Hello, I'm Robin. I've be raised a physicist, but now I try to figure out the brain as a PhD student at the [Research Center JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Forschung/Gruen/artikel.html), Germany. Concretely, I try to understand and characterize neural network dynamics, including correlation structures and traveling activity waves. And whenever I have the chance I dabble in data visualization. <br>
Besides that, I live in the beautiful city of Cologne and spend a considerable time woodworking, cooking, fermenting, and organizing things in lists. <br>
I use this space to blog about research related topics, but also potentially about anything I find interesting and/or amusing.
