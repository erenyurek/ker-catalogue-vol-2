Today, neuroscience finds itself in a situation where the picture of a neuron's structure is fairly detailed and its working mechanisms are relatively well understood. <br>
This very vaguely formulated introduction sentence already hints at the limitations of our current knowledge. Many of the intricate small-scale mechanisms are still to be understood, and there are still heavy disputes on aspects of their function. One example of an open disagreements would be the rate-coding vs. temporal-coding debate. So although there exists a whole range of very sophisticated neuron models which can accurately simulate many neuronal functions, there is still plenty of ground to cover on the quest towards a complete understanding of nerve cells. Therefore, I think it is beneficial to also have a look back, at how we arrived at our current knowledge and if there are any lessons to be learned for the future progress. So let's do exactly that and recall some of the influential historic developments which shaped today's view of neurons.

<h3>Balloons</h3>
When tracing back neuroscientific developments, we can go far far back into the past. In fact, archaeological findings show that humans practiced neurosurgery as early as [7000 B.C.](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09084-0). The first prominent theory of the brain involving the idea of neurons, however, was only formulated some centuries later. The Greek physician Galen (129 - 210) put forward his theory of a hydraulic mechanisms in the body, where signals were represented as varying pressure within the assumed hollow neurons. This pressure could in turn produce movement by inflating and deflating muscles just as balloons. This so-called *balloonist* theory was immensely popular for a long time, and was still the prevalent neuronal theory until the late 17th century. Also Rene Descartes was an outspoken balloonist, and describes the mechanisms of the balloon model in detail in his book ['De Homine'](https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=TUIUAAAAQAAJ) in 1662.
As silly as such a theory might sound in hindsight, considering the limited technological possibilities and lack of some fundamental biological insights, it is within it self an absolutely plausible idea. Actually, it is very much doable to build some simple moving machine based on such hydraulic mechanisms.

Nearly 1500 years later, it was still the dominant theory of how the nervous system operates. Therefore, it may be understandable that it took many years and a range of contradictory experimental findings to finally refute this neural model which was the general understanding for such a long time. While the evidence against this theory accumulated (as collected for example by [Jan Sammerdam](http://www.janswammerdam.org/NRN.pdf)), the belief in balloon-neurons grew weaker. This, however, left a void in the scientific community of the late 17th century, as there was no strong opposing theory to take its place. So people were reluctant to let their balloons go.
However, the key to a new neural theory was already waiting around the corner. In the beginning of the 18th century the discovery and study of electrical phenomena was gaining traction. The most famous of which, [although it never happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwZjm6SSTLw), was Benjamin Franklin flying a kite with an attached key in a thunderstorm to prove the electric nature of lightning. But it was not until a bright Italian professor took an interest in the emerging topic of 'medical electricity' and its practice of rubbing frog skin to generate static electricity.

<h3>Frogs</h3>
Luigi Galvani, was not predestined for academia. In fact, only a series of fortunate events led him down a path of pioneering a whole new field of science. He was not born into an aristocratic family, but his parents valued education very much and were in the rare financial position of being able to send at least one of their sons to university. Luigi, however, had his own plans, and instead wanted to join the church a pursue a religious career. Mr. and Mrs. Galvani, as the responsible parents they were, eventually managed to convince their son to let religion be and inscribe in the university of Bologna. So, he graduated in medicine and philosophy, and got a job as lecturer, which paved the way to his later professorship. It might have also helped that he married the daughter of one of his professors, whose position he later overtook.
Around 1780, according to the legend, he was skinning a frog when an electrical charge from his scalpel jumped over to the frogs exposed leg muscle, causing the leg to kick as if it were alive.
This surprising observation sparked Galvani's curiosity and led him to postulate a new theory of the nervous system which wasn't based on the propagation of pressure but of electric charge. With his iconic discovery Galvani became synonymous with the phenomena of electrical transmission in neurons. Indeed, was it also initially termed 'Galvanism' until later replaced by the tongue-twister 'electrophysiology'. Galvani's strong evidence for the electric nature of the nervous system revolutionized the understanding of neurons. As it is in science, this new insight also opened up new questions. And what is otherwise an showcase story of curiosity, discovery, insight, and frogs, is only weakened by a futile disagreement about the underlying nature of these electric phenomena.

</a>

For Galvani and his students, the thought emerged that neurons carry some electrical liquid (also referred to as the 'animal spirit') which causes muscle movement and can be initiated by an external electrical discharge. The concept of charged dissolved particles in the electrical liquid was only introduced some years later by Michael Faraday, with William Whewell proposing the name 'ion', in 1834.
This view of an electricity inherent to the animal driving its movement and lifelines became very popular and even contributed to the inspiration of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. However, Galvani's doctrine was not without opposition, with the rising physicist Alessandro Volta becoming his strongest adversary.

Alessandro Volta, was in many regards quite similar to Galvani. Being born in 1745, he was only 8 years younger than Galvani, and was also similarly predispositioned towards religion (5 of his 8 siblings became priests). His parents, however, pushed him towards studying law, but instead, he became more and more interested in physics and especially electrical phenomena. He quickly became a well-respected scientist with inventions like the Electrophor to generate and transport electricity; the Volta-pistol, a methane based lighter; and an Elektroskop to measure voltage, or 'electromotive force' as it was called before being named after Volta himself. Reading the summary of Galvani's extensive studies, which was published in 1791, he became very impressed with the work and started to redo the experiments on his own. While he was able to replicate most of Galvani's results, he also came across more and more observations which contradicted Galvani's interpretation of the experiments. Mainly, he grew increasingly convinced that the electricity isn't an attribute of the animal but rather that an animal body only reacts to and amplifies an external electrical stimulus, meaning that contrary to Galvani's believes the electricity conducted within animals is of the same nature as the electricity which is conducted in metals, or the [atomosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_electricity).

</a>

Thus, an eager dispute began which spanned the last decade of the 18th century. While Volta and Galvani were disagreeing quite respectfully (it was actually Volta who coined the term 'Galvanism'), it was Galavani's students who were more resolute to win the argument. Especially, as Galvani became older and weakened by sickness, his nephew Giovanni Aldini took over to defend the theory of 'animal electricity'.
Much of the scientific disagreement was carried out by the construction of various forms of batteries. Galvani's student Eusebio Valli was the first to connect a series of dead and alive frogs together to accumulate charge and thus build a battery-like device. Fueled by the disagreement, Volta followed a similar approach to substantiate his theory as he constructed his Voltaic pile, a battery based on stacking metals with different electronegativity. In 1801, Volta presented his invention in Paris to Napoleon, who was at the time occupying the north of Italy. In general, Volta was not only admired in the scientific community but also very skilled in navigating the political environment, and was held high regard before and after Napoleon's invasion. Napoleon even rewarded him with the title of Count for his contributions. In the meanwhile Galvani died three years prior to the demonstration of the Voltaic pile, withdrawn, in poor health, and striped of his professorship due to disagreement with new the reign of Napoleon.

</a>

Even though the argument about the nature of nervous electricity seemed to be decided for most scientists, Galvani's followers choose to ignore the new evidence to further pursued the study of animal electricity, by building more and ever complex animal batteries. At the forefront, Giovanni Aldini who wired together eels, pigeons, rabbits, and even an ox head. However, even these obscure efforts couldn't change anything about the triumph of Alessandro Volta.

But Galvani's legacy doesn't end there. The resolution of the dispute wasn't as clear as the success of Volta indicated at the time. After all, the two types of batteries weren't so fundamentally different. Volta's battery of Zinc and Copper also used a layer of electrolyte-soaked paper. Although, he noticed that the battery performs better when using a salt solution instead of clear water, he was unaware that it was actually the chemical energy of this solution being transformed into the electrical energy which discharged the battery and produced a voltage. In his mind the source of the electricity was the combination of dissimilar metals and not a liquid medium. Furthermore, he strongly refute Galavani's claim that there is an ever existing charge disequilibrium within the animal, enabling the production of an electric pulse at any moment. As in a capacitor, which was invented about fifty years prior, this would require an isolating medium, and since animals were known as good conductors, this seemed implausible to Volta.

In retrospect, we thus see that both of these famous scientists' theories contained valuable correct parts as well as false claims, and the actual solution of the Galvani-Volta disagreement was not an either-or answer, but rather a combination of both theories strongest parts.
This historic case illustrates how the competitive spirit to prove or disprove a theory is accompanied by the danger of disregarding crucial new evidence and oversimplifying the assessment of the theories to be either all false or all true, instead of being a collection of ideas which each might hold their own merit.

########################################

## Reticular theory vs. neuron doctrine
* Camillo Golgi (1843-1926): developed staining method to contrast soma, axon, and dendrites against the background so they are clearly visible under a microscope (1873)
* Reticular theory:
    * proposed by Joseph von Gerlach (1871) and refined and popularised by Camillo Golgi
    * states that everything in the brain is a single continuous network
    * Golgi's early work actually shows independent axonal connections in the cerebellar cortex and the olfactory bulb, which he later than ignored in favor of the reticular theory
    * starting form 1877 various studies revealed evidence against this theory, and evidence that the nervous system consists of individual nervous cells grew
    * Especially the German scientists Wilhelm His and Wilhelm Waldeyer supported the cell theory of the brain and introduced the term 'neuron' for a nerve cell
* Neuron doctrine:
    * 1839: Theodor Schwann proposes that the tissue of all organisms are composed of cells
    * This view naturally expanded also to the brain and was studied e.g. by Jan Purkinje
    * The view of the brain as network of distinct cells is only one among many aspects of the neuron doctrine
* Reticular theory vs. neuron doctrine:
    * the reticular theory was strongly refuted in favor of the neuron doctrine by Ramon y Cajal (1888) who used Golgi's own staining technique to gather evidence for a discontinuous nature of the brain
    * the final evidence came in the 1950s with the electron microscope showing the synaptic gaps between neurons
    * Cajal and Golgi shared a Nobel Prize in 1906 for their work on the structure of the brain. However, even this didn't stop their fierce conflict
    * The neuron doctrine however needed to by updated into a 'reticular-ish' direction to incorporate the existence of electrical synapses, first found in the 1950s.

## Balloons
The balloonist theory states that neurons are hollow and carry air or fluid which inflates and deflates muscles according to varying hydraulic pressure. Based on Greek physician Galen (129-210), and Rene Descartes (1596-1650). In 1667 Thomas Willis further proposed that air was produced in muscles via chemical reactions similar causing the swelling of muscles.
This theory war refuted in the late 17th century by various experiments until finally replaced by the electrical understanding provided by Galvani.

## Frogs
* Luigi Galvani (1737-1798)
    * from a non-aristocratic family. The father was a goldsmith who had enough money to send one of his sons to university
    * Luigi first wanted to join the church, but his parents persuaded him not to do so
    * graduated in medicine and philosophy and continued to become a lecturer
    * he married the daughter of one of his professors, moved into their house and helped with his father-in-law's research until his death, when he overtook his professorship
    * became interested in the emerging field (mid 18th century) of 'medical electricity'
    * discovered 'by accident' that electrical stimulation causes frog legs to twitch and kick
    * provided basis for the understanding that electrical energy in living bodies is carried by electrical liquids (ions), in contrast to the earlier proposed balloonist theory
    * however he believed that animal electricity was of a different nature than the metal-metal electricity, which was defended by Alessandro Volta who proved his theory by building the first battery
    * the study of electrical transmission through nerves was named 'galvanism' until replaced by the term 'electrophysiology'
* Frog battery
    * first constructed by Eusebio Valli in 1790s
    * chain of multiple dead and/or alive frogs
    * the effect is based on the increase of electric potential due to injury
    * Valli followed the interpretation of Galvani. Contrary to Galvani he refused to adapt Volta's correct interpretation despite the evidence.
    * 1803 Giovanni Aldini (Galvani's nephew) showed that electricity can be obtained from an ox head. Followed by eel, pigeons, and rabbit batteries

* Alessandro Volta (1745-1827)
    * 8 siblings, 5 of which became priests
    * parents wanted him to study law
    * on his own he started reading and studying electricity
    * 1775 invented Electrophor (generate and transport electricity by influence)
    * invented Volta-pistol (methan based lighter)
    * 1783 invented Elektroskop to measure voltage, which was also named after him (1861)
    * 1792 he heard of frog experiment, but with different interpretation. He thought that the frog muscle is just the detector of electric charge collected by contact of different metalls, and not a condensator himself as Galvani thought.
    * The dispute motivated his later detailed studies of contact electricty which finally led to his invention of the  Voltaic pile, the first battery, in 1800.
    * profited greatly from his inventions, with numerous awards, honorary position, and fame in the scientific community, even when Napoleon conquered Italy. He even gave him the title of count.

    * In contrast to their followers, Galvani and Volta disagreed respectfully. It was Volta how coined the term 'Galvanism'



## Squids
* action potentials were already observed during the 19th century, e.g. by Hermann von Helmholtz who measured the velocity of action potentials
* 1952 Alan Hodgkin, Bernard Katz, Andrew Huxely showed the exact process how action potentials are generated and how they propagate
* They described their theory in their famous Hodgkin & Huxley neuron model which they derived from studying the giant axon of the squid.
* they introduced the idea of discrete ion channels being responsible for the action potential generation. This hypothesis was only confirmed more than 20 years later when the required patch-clamp techniques were developed to measure individual ion channels.

## The role of spikes in a network
* 1943 McCulloch & Pitts: Spikes as units for information processing (0s and 1s)
* note: although largely ignored, there are also non-spiking neurons!

## Rate vs. temporal coding

## Take-aways
* The fundamental theories of neuroscience could often only be confirmed decades later, when the technology sufficiently evolved.
* Conflicting hypothesis are the core of the scientific landscape. However, there is generally no need to take this too personal, and to update your view with new evidence.
