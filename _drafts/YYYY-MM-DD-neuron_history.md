Today, neuroscience finds itself in a situation where the picture of a neuron's structure is fairly detailed and its working mechanisms are relatively well understood. <br>
This very vaguely formulated introduction sentence already hints at the limitations of our current knowledge. Many of the intricate small-scale mechanisms are still to be understood, and there are still heavy disputes on aspects of their function. One example of an open disagreements would be the rate-coding vs. temporal-coding debate. So although there exists a whole range of very sophisticated neuron models which can accurately simulate many neuronal functions, there is still plenty of ground to cover on the quest towards a complete understanding of nerve cells. Therefore, I think it is beneficial to also have a look back, at how we arrived at our current knowledge and if there are any lessons to be learned for the future progress. So let's do exactly that and recall some of the influential historic developments which shaped the general view of neurons.

When tracing back neuroscientific developments, we can go far far back into the past. In fact, archaeological findings show that humans practiced neurosurgery as early as 7000 B.C. *LINK*. The first prominent theory of the brain involving the idea of neurons, however, was only formulated come centuries later. The Greek physician Galen (129 - 210) put forward his theory of hydraulic mechanisms in the body, where signals were represented as varying pressure within the hollow neurons. This pressure could in turn produce movement by inflating and deflating muscles just as balloons. This so-called *balloonist* theory was immensely popular for a long time, and was still the prevalent neuronal theory until the late 17th century. Also Rene Descartes was an outspoken balloonist, and *...*
As silly as such a theory might sound in hindsight, considering the limited technological possibilities and lack of some fundamental biological insights, it is within it self an absolutely plausible idea. Actually, it is very much doable to build some simple moving machine based on such hydraulic mechanisms. *Link to Metropolis?*


########################################

## Balloons
The balloonist theory states that neurons are hollow and carry air or fluid which inflates and deflates muscles according to varying hydraulic pressure. Based on Greek physician Galen (129-210), and Rene Descartes (1596-1650). In 1667 Thomas Willis further proposed that air was produced in muscles via chemical reactions similar causing the swelling of muscles.
This theory war refuted in the late 17th century by various experiments until finally replaced by the electrical understanding provided by Galvani.

## Frogs
* Luigi Galvani (1737-1798)
    * from a non-aristocratic family. The father was a goldsmith who had enough money to send one of his sons to university
    * Luigi first wanted to join the church, but his parents persuaded him not to do so
    * graduated in medicine and philosophy and continued to become a lecturer
    * he married the daughter of one of his professors, moved into their house and helped with his father-in-law's research until his death, when he overtook his professorship
    * became interested in the emerging field (mid 18th century) of 'medical electricity'
    * discovered 'by accident' that electrical stimulation causes frog legs to twitch and kick
    * provided basis for the understanding that electrical energy in living bodies is carried by electrical liquids (ions), in contrast to the earlier proposed balloonist theory
    * however he believed that animal electricity was of a different nature than the metal-metal electricity, which was defended by Alessandro Volta who proved his theory by building the first battery
    * the study of electrical transmission through nerves was named 'galvanism' until replaced by the term 'electrophysiology'
* Frog battery
    * first constructed by Eusebio Valli in 1790s
    * chain of multiple dead and/or alive frogs
    * the effect is based on the increase of electric potential due to injury
    * Valli followed the interpretation of Galvani. Contrary to Galvani he refused to adapt Volta's correct interpretation despite the evidence.
    * 1803 Giovanni Aldini showed that electricity can be obtained from an ox head. Followed by eel, pigeons, and rabbit batteries

## Reticular theory vs. neuron doctrine
* Camillo Golgi (1843-1926): developed staining method to contrast soma, axon, and dendrites against the background so they are clearly visible under a microscope (1873)
* Reticular theory:
    * proposed by Joseph von Gerlach (1871) and refined and popularised by Camillo Golgi
    * states that everything in the brain is a single continuous network
    * Golgi's early work actually shows independent axonal connections in the cerebellar cortex and the olfactory bulb, which he later than ignored in favor of the reticular theory
    * starting form 1877 various studies revealed evidence against this theory, and evidence that the nervous system consists of individual nervous cells grew
    * Especially the German scientists Wilhelm His and Wilhelm Waldeyer supported the cell theory of the brain and introduced the term 'neuron' for a nerve cell
* Neuron doctrine:
    * 1839: Theodor Schwann proposes that the tissue of all organisms are composed of cells
    * This view naturally expanded also to the brain and was studied e.g. by Jan Purkinje
    * The view of the brain as network of distinct cells is only one among many aspects of the neuron doctrine
* Reticular theory vs. neuron doctrine:
    * the reticular theory was strongly refuted in favor of the neuron doctrine by Ramon y Cajal (1888) who used Golgi's own staining technique to gather evidence for a discontinuous nature of the brain
    * the final evidence came in the 1950s with the electron microscope showing the synaptic gaps between neurons
    * Cajal and Golgi shared a Nobel Prize in 1906 for their work on the structure of the brain. However, even this didn't stop their fierce conflict
    * The neuron doctrine however needed to by updated into a 'reticular-ish' direction to incorporate the existence of electrical synapses, first found in the 1950s.

## Squids
* action potentials were already observed during the 19th century, e.g. by Hermann von Helmholtz who measured the velocity of action potentials
* 1952 Alan Hodgkin, Bernard Katz, Andrew Huxely showed the exact process how action potentials are generated and how they propagate
* They described their theory in their famous Hodgkin & Huxley neuron model which they derived from studying the giant axon of the squid.
* they introduced the idea of discrete ion channels being responsible for the action potential generation. This hypothesis was only confirmed more than 20 years later when the required patch-clamp techniques were developed to measure individual ion channels.

## The role of spikes in a network
* 1943 McCulloch & Pitts: Spikes as units for information processing (0s and 1s)
* note: although largely ignored, there are also non-spiking neurons!

## Rate vs. temporal coding

## Take-aways
* The fundamental theories of neuroscience could often only be confirmed decades later, when the technology sufficiently evolved.
* Conflicting hypothesis are the core of the scientific landscape. However, there is generally no need to take this too personal, and to update your view with new evidence.
