*What is noticing, and why is it useful to practice it*
*apply it to one of my favorite hobbies: napping.*

I close my eyes.
# adjusting body position for maximum comfort
# roaming thoughts
# some itch, I try to ignore
# loosing the presence of the body
# At this moment a leg or arm might twitch, bringing my thought back to reality but only for a very brief moment
# slight prickle feeling on the skin as the sleep paralysis sets in
# thoughts getting less coherent and may drift freely
# complete loss of feeling my own body
# the awareness of thinking thoughts vanishes to become either unconscious or I enter a dream state

*How does my face, tongue, jaw feel? when does it relax?*
